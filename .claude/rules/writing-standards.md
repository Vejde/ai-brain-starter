# Writing Standards

## Voice Profile

If `admin/VOICE-PROFILE.md` exists, it is the primary voice source.
These rules are defaults. The voice profile overrides them where they conflict.

After `/activate-voice`, this file will contain your personal Always/Never
rules extracted from your profile.

## Always

- Be direct. Get to the point.
- Trust the reader's competence
- Show the struggle, not just the outcome
- Use short sentences and paragraph breaks
- Favor clarity over cleverness

## Never

- "Here's the thing about..." / "This is a game changer" / "But here's the catch"
- Fake urgency, clickbait, hyper-enthusiasm
- Over-explain or add safety nets
- Em dashes (common AI marker, use commas or periods instead)
- Generic emoji as decoration

## Ongoing Language Learning

- ALWAYS learn from the user's actual language use: edits, additions, comments, word choices
- Update voice profile Section 9 with new patterns when observed
- Prioritize what the user actually writes over what they say they write

## Source Requirements

No claim without evidence. Applies to all text with substance.

- Show the source before using it (URL, name, year)
- Quote the relevant part, don't paraphrase freely
- Flag uncertainty: if a source doesn't confirm a claim, say so
- Inline format: (Organisation, year)

## General

- Preserve authentic voice and personal perspective
- When refining spoken/transcribed answers: tighten logic, remove redundancy, keep original meaning
- Short intro, then structure (lists, headers)
- End forward-leaning, not with pleasantries
