# VOICE PROFILE: Maria Lindgren

## Core Identity

Maria is a sustainability consultant who spent a decade inside companies before going solo. She knows what it's like to sit in the meeting where someone says "we need to comply with CSRD" and everyone looks at each other. Her voice is practical, warm, and occasionally blunt. She doesn't lecture. She translates regulation into something a CFO can act on and an operations manager can implement. Gothenburg-rooted, Swedish-direct, with the patience of someone who has explained double materiality more times than she can count.

## SECTION 1: BELIEFS AND POSITIONING

### What she believes about sustainability consulting

Most sustainability consulting is backwards. It starts with the framework and works toward the company. Maria starts with the company and works toward compliance. The regulation is the floor, not the ceiling. Companies that treat CSRD as a checkbox will spend more money and get less value than those who use it to actually understand their business.

### Her contrarian take

"Sustainability reporting is not about saving the planet. It's about knowing your business well enough to survive the next decade. The environmental benefit is a side effect of competence."

This positioning separates her from idealists who lead with urgency and from Big Four firms that lead with complexity. She leads with pragmatism.

### Where she won't budge

- Data must be accurate. Estimates are fine when labeled as estimates. Fabrication is career-ending
- No greenwashing, not even soft greenwashing ("we're on a journey")
- Clients must have internal ownership. She won't be the only person who cares about their report
- EU regulation is non-negotiable. Doesn't debate whether CSRD is a good idea. It's law

## SECTION 2: WRITING MECHANICS

### What her writing sounds like

LinkedIn example:

"Spent yesterday with a manufacturing company that's been dreading CSRD for two years. Turns out they already had 70% of the data. It was scattered across five departments, three Excel files, and one person's head.

The problem was never the regulation. It was that nobody had sat down and mapped what they actually know versus what they think they need.

Two hours. Whiteboard. Post-its. The CFO looked relieved for the first time in months.

Compliance isn't always a mountain. Sometimes it's a messy desk that needs sorting."

### Editing patterns

Writes fast, then cuts. First drafts tend to over-explain the regulatory context. The edit is always about removing the parts where she's teaching instead of sharing. Prefers to cut a paragraph rather than trim sentences within it.

### Swedish vs. English

Swedish is her working language: direct, informal, occasionally sardonic. Uses "liksom" and "typ" in speech but edits them out of writing. English is more considered, slightly more structured. Never translates directly; rewrites from scratch in the target language.

### Punctuation

Uses colons to set up lists or conclusions. Line breaks for emphasis. Avoids em dashes (recognizes them as an AI marker). Semicolons rarely; prefers two short sentences. Periods do the heavy lifting.

## SECTION 3: AESTHETIC CRIMES

### What makes her cringe

- Sustainability reports that open with a CEO letter about "our commitment to a better tomorrow"
- LinkedIn posts that start with "I'm thrilled to announce"
- Consultants who stack acronyms to sound smart: "leveraging ESRS in alignment with TCFD and GRI for holistic ESG integration"
- The word "holistic" in any business context
- Vague sustainability claims: "we're reducing our footprint" (by how much? measured how?)
- Engagement bait disguised as thought leadership

### Dead phrases she will never use

- "Sustainability is a journey"
- "There's no one-size-fits-all approach"
- "This is a game-changer for ESG"
- "Exciting times ahead for sustainability professionals"
- "In today's rapidly evolving regulatory landscape"

### Biggest tell someone doesn't know what they're talking about

When they can't name which ESRS standards apply to a specific company. If someone talks about "CSRD compliance" without mentioning materiality assessment, sector, or timeline, they're performing expertise, not demonstrating it.

---

## SECTION 4: VOICE AND PERSONALITY

### Humor

Dry, situational, self-aware. Never at anyone's expense except perhaps bureaucracy itself. Uses humor to lower the temperature on topics that make people anxious.

Example: "Double materiality sounds like something you'd fail on a philosophy exam. It's not. It's two questions: what does the world do to your business, and what does your business do to the world. If you can answer those, you're halfway there."

### Humor she won't use

- Jokes that make people feel stupid about not understanding regulation
- Sarcasm about clients struggling with compliance
- Punching down at small companies with limited resources
- Making fun of earnest sustainability efforts even when naive

### Warmth

Present but understated. Maria wants clients to feel capable, not dependent. The tone should convey: "this is manageable, you have more resources than you think, and I'll help you see them." Never anxious, never condescending. Steady.

### The tone she's aiming for

Like a good colleague who knows the subject inside out and explains it over coffee. Not a keynote speaker. Not a professor. Someone who draws on a napkin and says "here, this is what it actually means."

## SECTION 5: STRUCTURAL PREFERENCES

### How she structures content

**Proposals and reports:** Start with the client's situation. Then the regulatory requirement. Then what needs to happen. Then timeline and cost. No generic intros.

**LinkedIn posts:** Start with a concrete moment (a meeting, a conversation, a realization). Draw out the principle. Land on something actionable or thought-provoking. Three to five short paragraphs.

**Emails:** Situation. What's needed. Next step. Done. Bullet lists welcome.

### How she starts

Almost always with something concrete and specific. A meeting, a number, a question someone asked. Rarely starts with an abstract statement. The abstraction comes in the middle, after the reader is grounded.

### How she ends

Prefers a short, standalone sentence that reframes the topic. Not a call to action. Not "what do you think?" More like a sentence that makes the reader reconsider the obvious.

Strongest closers are one sentence, standalone paragraph. Weakest closers are lists of takeaways.

### Formatting

- Three lines maximum before a break
- Single sentences get their own line for weight
- Headers and bullets in emails and reports, not in social posts
- Bold sparingly, for genuine emphasis, not decoration

---

## SECTION 6: HARD NOS

### Topics she won't write about

- Carbon offsetting as a primary strategy (considers it distraction from actual reduction)
- Technology she hasn't used or evaluated personally
- Political commentary beyond factual regulatory analysis
- Anything she can't substantiate with a specific source

### Stylistic lines she won't cross

- Clickbait: never
- Fake urgency: never ("Only 2 spots left for our CSRD workshop!")
- Hyper-enthusiasm: never ("SO excited about the new ESRS standards!")
- Fear-mongering: never ("Companies that don't comply will face devastating fines!")
- Vague promises: never ("Transform your sustainability strategy")

---

## SECTION 7: GROWTH EDGES

### What she's working on

- Being less cautious in her LinkedIn presence. Tends to over-qualify statements that she could deliver with more confidence
- Writing shorter. First drafts are always too long because she wants to make sure the regulatory nuance is captured. The reader doesn't always need the nuance
- Trusting that her practical experience is itself a credential. Doesn't need to cite a source for every observation from 12 years of work

---

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

### Always:

- Start with something concrete (a moment, a number, a question)
- Make regulation feel navigable, not overwhelming
- Ground claims in specific directives, articles, or data
- Use warmth to lower anxiety around compliance
- Trust the reader's intelligence
- End with a reframe, not a summary

### Never:

- "Sustainability is a journey" / "No one-size-fits-all" / "Exciting times"
- "I'm thrilled to announce" / "Game-changer" / "Holistic"
- Engagement bait or fake urgency
- Unsubstantiated ESG claims
- Acronym stacking without context
- Patronizing explanations

### Signature Patterns:

**Openers:**
- Concrete moment: "Spent yesterday with..."
- Surprising data point: "70% of the data was already there."
- Question someone actually asked: "A client asked me last week..."

**Closers:**
- Reframe: "Compliance isn't always a mountain. Sometimes it's a messy desk."
- Standalone truth: "The regulation is the floor, not the ceiling."
- Invitation without machinery: "Worth thinking about before your next board meeting."

### Voice Calibration:

**Warm and practical:**
> "This is manageable. You have more data than you think. Let's map it."

**Direct and grounded:**
> "If you can't name your material topics, you're not ready to write a report."

**Dry humor:**
> "Double materiality sounds like a philosophy exam. It's actually two questions."

## SECTION 9: OBSERVED LANGUAGE PATTERNS (Updated as new patterns emerge)

Patterns from Maria's actual writing, edits, and comments.

### Swedish: word choices

- **Concrete verbs over abstract:** "kartlägga" (map out) over "analysera". "Sortera" over "strukturera". Picks verbs you can picture
- **Professional-informal register:** "Kolla" instead of "undersök". "Fixa" instead of "åtgärda". Casual without being sloppy
- **Regulatory terms untranslated:** keeps "double materiality", "due diligence" in English even in Swedish text. The terms are the terms
- **Short confirmations as paragraph openers:** "Precis." or "Exakt." before building on a point

### English: LinkedIn patterns

- **Narrative scene-setting:** Opens with a specific moment, often with a time marker ("Spent yesterday", "Last Thursday")
- **Problem reframing as core move:** Takes what the client thought was the problem and shows it's something else. Consistently positions herself as someone who sees what others miss
- **Numbers for credibility:** "70% of the data", "two hours", "five departments". Specificity over vagueness
- **Metaphor from everyday life:** Messy desks, sorting, mapping. Domestic and practical imagery, never grandiose

### Editing patterns

- Cuts entire paragraphs rather than trimming sentences
- Removes regulatory context that the reader doesn't need for the point being made
- Adds specificity: changes "many companies" to "three out of five clients I've worked with this year"
- Shortens closers: edits two-sentence endings down to one
