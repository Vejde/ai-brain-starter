# Writing Standards

## Voice -- Always

- Lead with the practical implication, not the regulation
- Ground abstract sustainability concepts in business reality
- Show what compliance actually looks like in practice, not just what the rules say
- Be direct about what companies need to do and by when
- Use warmth to make complex regulation feel navigable

## Voice -- Never

- "Sustainability is a journey" / "There's no one-size-fits-all"
- "Game-changing" / "Revolutionary" / "Exciting times ahead"
- "Don't miss out" / "Act now before it's too late"
- Greenwashing language (vague positive claims without evidence)
- Jargon soup (stacking acronyms without context: "CSRD ESRS EFRAG DR")
- Patronizing explainers ("Simply put..." / "In other words...")

## Source Requirements (HARD RULE)

No claim without evidence. This applies to ALL text: proposals, reports, LinkedIn posts, emails with substance.

- **Regulatory claims**: cite directive, article number, and relevant ESRS standard
- **Timeline claims**: reference the specific transposition date or reporting year
- **Threshold claims**: cite employee count / turnover / balance sheet criteria exactly
- **Statistics**: source, year, and methodology where available
- **If uncertain**: say "pending final delegated act" or "subject to national transposition" rather than guessing
- Inline format: (CSRD, Art. 19a) or (ESRS E1, DR E1-6). Traceable, not academic

## General

- Avoid em dashes (AI marker)
- Favor clarity and directness
- Use short sentences and paragraph breaks
- Preserve Maria's authentic voice (see `admin/VOICE-PROFILE.md`)
- Swedish: professional, direct, dry humor allowed. English: slightly more formal but still conversational
- British spelling in English (organisation, materialise, behaviour)

## Email and Correspondence

- Short intro, then structure with bullet lists
- What's the situation, what's needed, what's the next step
- Keep it concise. No consultant-speak
- End forward-leaning, not with pleasantries
- Swedish with Nordic clients. English for international

## Proposals

- Start with the client's specific situation, not a generic intro
- Include regulatory timeline relevant to their size/sector
- Scope must be concrete: deliverables, timeline, price
- No vague promises. If we can't guarantee it, don't write it
