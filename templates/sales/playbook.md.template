# {{COMPANY_NAME}} -- Sales Process

## Step 1: First Contact

**Goal:** Understand if they're a fit, book a meeting

**Questions to ask:**
- What prompted you to reach out?
- Where are you today with {{YOUR_DOMAIN}}?
- What would change if you could {{DESIRED_OUTCOME}}?
- What has held you back so far?

**Red flags (end politely):**
- {{RED_FLAG_1}}
- {{RED_FLAG_2}}

**Green flags (continue):**
- {{GREEN_FLAG_1}}
- {{GREEN_FLAG_2}}

## Step 2: Needs Analysis

**Goal:** Understand their situation deeply enough to propose the right offering

- What does your current process look like?
- What have you tried before?
- Who else is involved in this decision?
- What does success look like for you?

## Step 3: Proposal

- Reference the specific problems they described
- Match to your productized offering (see offerings.md)
- Show clear deliverables and timeline
- Price based on value, not hours

## Step 4: Negotiation

**Principles:**
- Don't discount price, adjust scope
- Your positioning is not negotiable
- Better no deal than a bad deal
- Silence is okay. Don't fill it with concessions.

## Step 5: Close

- Confirm scope, timeline, price in writing
- Clear next steps with dates
- Invoice terms upfront
