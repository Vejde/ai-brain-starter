# Interview Guide

100 structured questions for building your voice profile. Go through them in order, but don't rush. Some of these will be uncomfortable. That's where the good answers are.

Each question includes:
- **The question** itself
- **Why it's asked** — what it reveals about your voice
- **Example answer** — what a real answer might sound like (generalized)

Take your time. Speak your answers aloud before writing them down. Your spoken voice is closer to your real voice than your written one.

One more thing: 80% of what makes your voice yours is what you refuse to do. Pay extra attention to the questions about boundaries, crimes, and hard nos. That's where the real profile lives.

## Section 1: Beliefs & Contrarian Takes (Q1-12)

These questions surface what you actually believe about communication — not what sounds good, but what you've learned through friction.

### Q1: What's something you believe about communication that most people would disagree with?

**Why:** Your contrarian takes reveal your actual values, not your performed ones. They show where you've diverged from conventional wisdom through experience.

**Example:** "I think most people communicate to be heard, not to listen. Including me. We're already composing our reply before the other person finishes."

### Q2: When was the last time you performed "being heard" rather than actually connecting?

**Why:** This catches the gap between who you want to be and who you are in the moment. That gap is where your voice lives.

**Example:** "At a networking event, I told a personal story expecting it to land as polished and impressive. Instead, the raw, unpolished version — where I admitted I had no idea what I was doing — connected more."

### Q3: What's your relationship with silence?

**Why:** How you handle silence in writing reveals your confidence. Over-explaining fills silence. Trusting the reader embraces it.

**Example:** "In conversation, I fill it. In writing, I'm learning to leave space. Silence is also power — pausing before responding sends a message."

### Q4: When someone disagrees with you publicly, what's your instinct?

**Why:** Your conflict style shows up in your writing more than you think. Do you hedge? Double down? Get diplomatic? Get cold?

**Example:** "Stone cold, polite surface. Not a pushover, not over-apologetic. I'll say something like 'I appreciate your perspective' in a tone that makes clear I don't appreciate it at all."

### Q5: Do you admit fault to earn the right to criticize?

**Why:** This reveals whether your voice is confessional (starts with vulnerability) or declarative (starts with position). Both work. Knowing which you default to matters.

**Example:** "Not enough. But when I do — when I show vulnerability first — it creates space for real dialogue instead of debate."

### Q6: What's a belief you won't budge on, no matter the context?

**Why:** Your non-negotiables are the foundation of your voice. They determine where you're direct and where you're diplomatic.

**Example:** "Accountability. You own your actions and your words. Facts don't care about opinions and feelings."

### Q7: When do you hold back, and why?

**Why:** Where you self-censor tells you where you might be performing instead of communicating.

**Example:** "When I'm outside my deep expertise. I lean on sources as safety belts — citing others instead of stating my own position."

### Q8: What's the most important thing you've changed your mind about?

**Why:** How you describe changing your mind reveals your relationship with being wrong — and being wrong publicly.

**Example:** "I used to think vulnerability was weakness. Now I know it's the only thing that actually connects. But I still fight the instinct to armor up."

### Q9: What opinion do you hold that would surprise people who think they know you?

**Why:** The gap between your public persona and your actual positions is material for your voice. It shows where you're still performing.

**Example:** "People assume I'm anti-AI because I'm critical of it. I'm not. I use it constantly. I'm critical because I want it to be better."

### Q10: Do you believe in consensus?

**Why:** Your stance on consensus determines whether your voice seeks alignment or provocation.

**Example:** "No. Consensus means everyone's comfortable and nothing's changed. The interesting work starts where people disagree."

### Q11: What's a truth about your industry that nobody wants to say out loud?

**Why:** Industry truths reveal the positions you're willing to take professionally. These often become your strongest content.

**Example:** "Most consultants sell clarity they don't have. The honest answer is 'I don't know yet' but that doesn't close deals."

### Q12: When was the last time you were genuinely wrong — and what did it cost you?

**Why:** How you narrate failure reveals your voice at its most honest. The cost is what makes it real.

**Example:** "I gave advice I wasn't qualified to give, because saying 'I don't know' felt like losing. It cost me a relationship I valued."

---

## Section 2: Writing Mechanics (Q13-27)

Now we look at how you actually write — not how you think you write.

### Q13: Find something you wrote recently that you're proud of. Read it aloud. What do you hear?

**Why:** Reading aloud reveals rhythm, cadence, and authenticity. Your ear catches what your eye misses.

**Example:** "I hear long sentences that build, then a short punch. I hear myself thinking out loud. The parts I'm proudest of are where I stopped explaining and just stated."

### Q14: Find something you wrote that makes you cringe. What's wrong with it?

**Why:** Your cringe response is your quality filter. It shows you what you're growing away from.

**Example:** "Too many qualifiers. 'I think maybe we could possibly consider...' — I knew exactly what I wanted to say but was afraid to say it."

### Q15: How do you edit? What's the first thing you change?

**Why:** Your editing pattern reveals the gap between your first instinct and your final voice. The edit is where the real voice emerges.

**Example:** "First thing: sentence length. I write long, then break. Second: remove hedging words. Third: inject something personal."

### Q16: How does your first draft differ from your final?

**Why:** The distance between draft and final shows what you perform vs. what you choose. Some people start formal and get casual. Others start raw and polish.

**Example:** "First drafts are safe and over-explained. Final versions have heat, personality, and half as many words."

### Q17: What punctuation do you rely on? What do you avoid?

**Why:** Punctuation is rhythm. It determines whether your writing feels like conversation or essay.

**Example:** "Colons and line breaks. Semicolons when I want flexibility. No em dashes — AI ruined those. Periods for emphasis. Short sentences get their own line."

### Q18: If you write in more than one language — how does your voice change?

**Why:** Bilingual writers often have different registers in each language. Knowing this prevents flattening your voice to one mode.

**Example:** "In Swedish I'm fiercer, more profanity as texture. In English I'm more measured. I wish I could write in English the way I write in Swedish."

### Q19: What words or phrases do you keep returning to?

**Why:** Your recurring words are your verbal fingerprint. They reveal your default positions and thinking patterns.

**Example:** "'I think' — positions as perspective, not truth. 'At the same time' — holds contradictions. 'Definitely' — when certain. Profanity as texture, not shock."

### Q20: How long are your sentences before you feel the need to break?

**Why:** Sentence length tolerance is one of the most distinctive markers of voice. Some people write in bursts. Others in waves.

**Example:** "Two lines is my threshold. After that, something needs to be split or the reader loses the thread. But I always write long first, then edit."

### Q21: Do you write to think, or think then write?

**Why:** This determines whether your writing process is generative (write to discover) or executive (plan then write). It affects how AI should draft for you.

**Example:** "Write to think. Always. The first draft is me figuring out what I actually believe. The edit is where I decide what to keep."

### Q22: What's the ratio of personal to abstract in your writing? Where does the personal earn its place?

**Why:** Some voices are story-first. Others are idea-first. Knowing your ratio prevents the profile from forcing one mode.

**Example:** "I open personal, pivot abstract, then close with something concrete. The personal earns its place by making the abstract real — not by being interesting on its own."

### Q23: How do you handle transitions between ideas?

**Why:** Transitions reveal how you think about the reader's journey. Do you bridge? Do you jump? Do you trust the gap?

**Example:** "Whitespace. I don't bridge with 'and speaking of...' or 'this also applies to...' I stop. Leave a line. Start the next thought. Trust the reader to connect."

### Q24: Do you use metaphors? What kind? Where do they come from?

**Why:** Your metaphor choices reveal your frame of reference and worldview. Physical metaphors signal a different mind than intellectual ones.

**Example:** "Physical and violent ones. Things get 'stöpta om' (recast like metal), not 'transformed.' I reach for metaphors that have weight and body."

### Q25: What does your writing look like when you're writing fast and not thinking about quality?

**Why:** Your unguarded writing is often closer to your real voice than your polished work. The unconscious style is data.

**Example:** "Long sentences. Stream of consciousness. More 'I' than usual. Sentence fragments. The heat is higher but the structure is gone."

### Q26: Paste a paragraph you wrote and a paragraph AI wrote for you. What's the difference you can feel but can't easily name?

**Why:** The gap between your writing and AI's imitation of it is exactly what the voice profile needs to close. Naming the unnamed difference is the whole point.

**Example:** "Mine has cracks in it. Uneven rhythm. A sentence that's too long next to one that's too short. The AI version is smooth but flat — like a cover band. Technically right, emotionally empty."

### Q27: What's a word you love? A word you hate? Why?

**Why:** Single-word preferences reveal aesthetic sensibility at the atomic level.

**Example:** "Love: 'profound' — it reaches for depth without pretending to have it. Hate: 'leverage' — it pretends human relationships are machinery."

---

## Section 3: Aesthetic Crimes (Q28-42)

What you hate reveals what you value. Be specific and unforgiving here. This section should be the longest part of your profile — taste is defined by what you refuse.

### Q28: What makes AI-generated text obvious to you?

**Why:** Your AI detection is your quality standard. It tells us what to never do.

**Example:** "Overuse of em dashes. Exaggerated hooks. Platitude formatting. Americanized sales pitch style. 'You won't believe' tag phrases."

### Q29: What phrases would you never use? List as many as you can.

**Why:** Your "dead phrases" list is the most concrete part of your voice profile. These are hard rules.

**Example:** "'Here's the thing about leadership.' 'This is a game changer.' 'But here's the catch.' 'I recently.' These are the sounds of someone performing insight."

### Q30: What makes other people's professional writing cringe for you?

**Why:** Your cringe about others' writing reveals your aesthetic standards in a way that self-reflection alone can't.

**Example:** "Performative reflection. False profundity. Coaching formula with engagement bait. Emojis as emotional crutches. The cringe is when someone almost says something real but wraps it in engagement machinery."

### Q31: What's the biggest tell that someone is performing expertise rather than having it?

**Why:** How you spot fakes tells us what you value in authentic communication.

**Example:** "They only show outcomes, never struggle. Real experts admit what they didn't know. Performers show what they want you to believe they knew all along."

### Q32: Finish this sentence: "I'd rather sound _______ than _______."

**Why:** Forces a binary choice that clarifies your voice priority.

**Example:** "I'd rather sound uncertain than dishonest." / "I'd rather sound blunt than diplomatic."

### Q33: What opening lines make you stop reading immediately?

**Why:** Your bail-out triggers are hard boundaries. These go directly into the "never" list.

**Example:** "'You won't believe what happened next.' 'In today's fast-paced world.' Anything that announces significance instead of earning it."

### Q34: What closing lines make you lose respect for the writer?

**Why:** How someone ends reveals what they want from you. Your cringe endings tell us what you think writing should never ask for.

**Example:** "'Follow me for more tips.' 'What do you think? Comment below!' The machinery showing. Writing should land, not beg."

### Q35: What formatting choices signal amateur to you?

**Why:** Visual aesthetics are part of voice. What you find amateur tells us what to avoid structurally.

**Example:** "Overuse of bold. Random capitalization for emphasis. Emojis as section headers. Walls of text. The LinkedIn carousel format."

### Q36: What tone of voice makes you distrust the writer?

**Why:** The tones you distrust are the tones you'll never use. Distrust is a faster signal than preference.

**Example:** "Breathless enthusiasm. 'I'm SO thrilled.' If someone is that excited about everything, they're excited about nothing."

### Q37: What's the difference between confidence and arrogance in writing? Where's the line for you?

**Why:** Your confidence/arrogance boundary determines how assertive your voice profile should be.

**Example:** "Confidence says 'here's what I think and why.' Arrogance says 'here's what you should think.' The difference is whether you leave room for the reader to disagree."

### Q38: What cliches does your industry use that you refuse to?

**Why:** Industry-specific dead language is often the hardest to eliminate because everyone uses it. Naming it makes it catchable.

**Example:** "'Synergy.' 'Scalable solutions.' 'Thought leadership.' If I catch these in my own writing, something has gone wrong."

### Q39: What's a writing trend you think is actively harmful?

**Why:** Your position on trends reveals whether your voice follows or resists cultural currents.

**Example:** "The 'hook at all costs' trend. Every post needs to open with something outrageous. It trains people to perform instead of communicate."

### Q40: Show me an example of writing you admire. What makes it work?

**Why:** Your admiration map is the positive version of your cringe list. Together they triangulate your taste.

**Example:** "A colleague wrote: 'Maybe your product should be: Strategic Precision Training. Target audience: boards and steering committees.' Three lines. No over-explaining. Trusts me to fill the gaps."

### Q41: What does "too polished" look like? When does editing kill the voice?

**Why:** The over-editing boundary tells us when to stop refining.

**Example:** "When every sentence is the same length. When there are no rough edges. When it reads like a press release instead of a person. The cracks are where the personality lives."

### Q42: If you could ban one word from professional communication forever, what would it be?

**Why:** Your single-word ban reveals your deepest aesthetic conviction.

**Example:** "'Leverage.' Every time someone says 'let's leverage this' I hear 'I have nothing original to say but I want to sound strategic.'"

---

## Section 4: Voice & Personality (Q43-55)

The texture of your writing — humor, warmth, edge.

### Q43: How do you use humor? Give an example.

**Why:** Humor is one of the hardest things for AI to replicate. Your humor style is a core identifier.

**Example:** "Self-deprecating, punches up. 'My coding skills are almost equal to those I have in Finnish — no one, including myself, knows what I'm trying to say.'"

### Q44: What humor would you never use?

**Why:** Humor boundaries reveal values. Where you refuse to joke shows what you protect.

**Example:** "Never punch down. Never mock eagerness to learn. Never joke about kids."

### Q45: What's your emoji philosophy?

**Why:** Surprisingly revealing. How you use (or don't use) emojis says something about how you think about tone and signaling.

**Example:** "An emoji should create a 'what is this?' moment. It should make someone pause, not just process it as decoration. Mechanical arm yes. Fire no."

### Q46: Describe the feeling you want your reader to have after reading something you wrote.

**Why:** This is the emotional target for your entire voice profile. Everything else serves this.

**Example:** "A warm breeze of comfort that this will go well. Sincere, informative, lightly humorous — and underneath, reassuring. A levelized field: no one above, no one below."

### Q47: When your writing is at its best, what adjectives describe it?

**Why:** Your self-assessment when things work reveals your aspiration.

**Example:** "Direct. Warm. Layered. Like a conversation with someone who knows their stuff but doesn't need you to know they know."

### Q48: When your writing is at its worst, what goes wrong?

**Why:** Your failure mode is something we need to actively guard against in the profile.

**Example:** "Over-explaining. Circling. Hedging. Adding crash pads — safety nets I don't actually need."

### Q49: What's the subtlety in your voice that's hardest to capture?

**Why:** This is usually the most important thing in the entire profile. The thing that makes it you and not just "a good writer."

**Example:** "The warmth. It's not explicit warmth — it's structural. It's in the assumption that the reader is competent, in the lack of condescension, in the way hard truths are delivered with care but not softening."

### Q50: How do you handle disagreement in writing? Show, don't tell.

**Why:** Your disagreement style — the actual mechanics of how you push back in text — is a core voice marker.

**Example:** "Polite surface, steel underneath. 'I appreciate your efforts to align the language of what you find suitable' — says everything without raising my voice."

### Q51: What role does vulnerability play in your writing? When does it earn its place?

**Why:** Vulnerability without purpose is performance. Vulnerability with purpose is connection. Knowing your line matters.

**Example:** "It earns its place when it serves the point — when my failure teaches something. It doesn't earn its place when it's a bid for sympathy."

### Q52: How do you signal authority without claiming it?

**Why:** Your authority style determines whether your voice sounds earned or imposed.

**Example:** "By showing the process, not just the conclusion. By admitting what I don't know. By being specific instead of vague — specificity is its own authority."

### Q53: What does your voice sound like when you're angry? When you're excited? When you're uncertain?

**Why:** Your emotional range in writing determines how dynamic the profile needs to be. Some voices are narrow-band. Others shift dramatically.

**Example:** "Angry: shorter sentences, more periods, less warmth but still controlled. Excited: longer sentences, more metaphor, more 'you' and 'we.' Uncertain: more questions, more 'I think,' softer endings."

### Q54: Do you swear in writing? When? What's the rule?

**Why:** Profanity has grammar. When and how you use it is a precise voice marker.

**Example:** "Yes, but as texture, not shock. 'The void of utter dumbass solutions' — that's how I actually talk. In Swedish, more freely. In English, sparingly and deliberately."

### Q55: What's the most "you" sentence you've ever written?

**Why:** If you can point to one sentence that captures your voice perfectly, everything else in the profile serves to recreate the conditions that produced it.

**Example:** "'I have no fucking idea what I'm doing and I hope to God that I'm doing right.' That's me. Vulnerable, direct, a little profane, and entirely honest."

---

## Section 5: Structural Preferences (Q56-68)

How you build a piece of writing — beginning, middle, end.

### Q56: How do you start? What's your opening move?

**Why:** Your default opening reveals your relationship with the reader. Do you invite, declare, confess, or provoke?

**Example:** "Personal stake or confession. 'I used to think...' or a quote that lives rent-free in my head. Then I pivot to why it matters beyond me."

### Q57: How do you end? What does a good close feel like?

**Why:** Your closer reveals what you want the reader to do with what you've given them.

**Example:** "Declaration or provocation. 'The point was never being the best.' Or: 'Convince me I'm wrong.' Lands and leaves. Never asks for engagement explicitly."

### Q58: Describe your ideal structure for a social media post.

**Why:** Short-form structure reveals your instincts about pacing and density.

**Example:** "Figure-eight: broad opening, pinch in the middle where the insight lives, back to broad. Not a funnel — a loop."

### Q59: Describe your ideal structure for an email.

**Why:** Email structure reveals how you think about professional communication and respect for the reader's time.

**Example:** "Short intro. Straight to the point. What we agreed. What I've done. What needs attention. Next steps. Bold for emphasis, everything visible at a glance."

### Q60: What are your formatting rules?

**Why:** Formatting is voice. How you use whitespace, line breaks, and emphasis shapes how your writing is experienced.

**Example:** "Three lines max before a break. Single sentences get their own line for emphasis. Headers and bullets for emails and reports, not for social media."

### Q61: What structure do you admire in other people's writing?

**Why:** What you admire shows where you want to go, not just where you are.

**Example:** "Someone who writes 'Here's what I think. Here's why. Here's what you should do.' Three lines, done. Trusts the reader to fill gaps. Gives enough to act on, then stops."

### Q62: How do you handle the middle? The part between the hook and the close?

**Why:** Most people know how they start and end. The middle is where discipline lives — or dies.

**Example:** "The middle is where I lose myself. I go broad, then realize not everyone has the context, so I build scaffolding that shouldn't be there. Working on cutting instead of building."

### Q63: Do you use headers and subheaders? When? What's the rule?

**Why:** Hierarchical structure signals formality. Your header philosophy reveals how you think about reader navigation.

**Example:** "Headers for emails and reports. Never for social media — that's where the writing should flow without signposts."

### Q64: How do you handle lists? When are bullets appropriate?

**Why:** Lists are a formatting choice with voice implications. Some people think in lists. Others find them reductive.

**Example:** "Bullets for action items and emails. Never as a substitute for prose. If I'm using a list in a post, I've failed to write a paragraph."

### Q65: What's your paragraph length? When do you give a sentence its own line?

**Why:** Paragraph rhythm is one of the strongest voice markers in digital writing.

**Example:** "Short. Two to three sentences max. A sentence gets its own line when it's the point — when I want the reader to stop and sit with it."

### Q66: How do you structure a piece when you're writing about something complicated?

**Why:** Complexity handling reveals your teaching instinct. Do you simplify first? Build up? Start with the conclusion?

**Example:** "Martini glass. Start broad, funnel to the specific, then discuss implications. For truly complex topics, I start with 'here's why you should care' before 'here's what it is.'"

### Q67: What's your philosophy on length? When is something too long? Too short?

**Why:** Your length tolerance determines the operating range for your voice profile.

**Example:** "A LinkedIn post should be readable in one sitting without scrolling twice. An email should be scannable in 30 seconds. If it needs to be longer, it needs to be a different format."

### Q68: How do you know when a piece is done?

**Why:** Your "done" signal prevents both premature publishing and endless polishing.

**Example:** "When I've said the thing and stopped. When there's nothing left that serves the reader. The urge to add 'one more thing' is usually the signal to stop."

---

## Section 6: Hard Nos (Q69-78)

Non-negotiable boundaries. These become hard rules in your profile. This section is about refusal — and refusal is the backbone of taste.

### Q69: What topics will you never write about?

**Why:** Knowing your boundaries prevents your voice profile from producing content that feels inauthentic.

**Example:** "Anything I'm not genuinely interested in. The audience would see through the disinterest immediately."

### Q70: What stylistic choices are absolute dealbreakers for you?

**Why:** These become the "Never" list in your quick reference card.

**Example:** "Clickbait. Fake urgency. Hyper-enthusiasm. Vague mystery hooks. I'd rather have zero engagement than engagement earned through manipulation."

### Q71: What would you never do for engagement?

**Why:** Where you draw the line on engagement tactics defines your integrity as a communicator.

**Example:** "'Follow me to learn more.' 'Comment your thoughts.' The explicit ask — the machinery showing. Hard no."

### Q72: Is there a format or medium you refuse to use?

**Why:** Sometimes voice is defined as much by what you won't do as what you will.

**Example:** "Carousels with 'swipe for more.' Slideshows. PDFs to download. If I can't say it in text, I need to think harder."

### Q73: What would you never write even if it would perform well?

**Why:** The things you'd sacrifice reach for reveal where your integrity lives.

**Example:** "Engagement bait disguised as questions. 'What do you think?' at the end of every post. Vague provocations designed to farm comments."

### Q74: What's a popular writing style in your space that you actively reject?

**Why:** Active rejection is stronger data than passive absence. The styles you've consciously chosen not to adopt define your voice.

**Example:** "The 'I generated 1 million in revenue and here's how you can too' template. The promise of replicable success. It's dishonest."

### Q75: Where do you draw the line between honest and oversharing?

**Why:** Your vulnerability boundary determines how personal the profile should go.

**Example:** "I'll share failures and uncertainty. I won't share family details, health issues, or anything that uses intimacy as currency."

### Q76: What's a compliment about your writing that would actually bother you?

**Why:** The compliment you'd reject reveals the voice you're trying to avoid.

**Example:** "'So professional!' If my writing sounds 'professional' in the corporate sense, it's lost its soul."

### Q77: What would make you delete something you've already published?

**Why:** Your deletion threshold reveals your publishing standard — and the difference between imperfection you accept and error you don't.

**Example:** "If I realize I was wrong about the facts. Not if people disagree — only if the foundation was false."

### Q78: If your writing were a place, what places would it never be?

**Why:** Spatial metaphors for voice unlock intuitions that direct description misses.

**Example:** "Never a boardroom. Never a TED stage. Maybe a kitchen table, late evening, good wine, honest conversation."

---

## Section 7: Red Flags & Credibility (Q79-88)

How you think about authenticity and expertise.

### Q79: How do you spot fake expertise in others' writing?

**Why:** Your bullshit detector becomes your quality standard for your own writing.

**Example:** "Too many positive notes. 'Don't miss out.' Showing outcomes without process. Real expertise shows the struggle."

### Q80: Have you ever been publicly challenged or dismantled? How did it change your writing?

**Why:** Professional conflict shapes voice more than anything else. The scars are where the strength is.

**Example:** "Made me tougher. Now I write with more clarity, more certainty in areas where I've earned it. More measured where I haven't."

### Q81: When do you use sources and citations? When do you stand alone?

**Why:** Your relationship with authority and evidence shows up in how confident your voice sounds.

**Example:** "I lean on sources as safety belts when I'm outside my comfort zone. Working on standing on my own expertise more — knowing that the 10,000 hours have earned me the right to an opinion."

### Q82: What would make you lose credibility in your own eyes?

**Why:** Your credibility standard is the ceiling your voice profile should never exceed.

**Example:** "Writing with false certainty about something I don't understand deeply. The 'emperor's new clothes' scenario."

### Q83: How do you calibrate confidence across different topics? Where are you bold and where are you careful?

**Why:** Voice profiles that are uniformly confident or uniformly humble sound fake. Real voices calibrate.

**Example:** "Bold on AI adoption, leadership, and communication — 10,000+ hours. Careful on technical implementation, policy specifics, and markets I don't know."

### Q84: What's the difference between influence and manipulation in writing?

**Why:** Your influence/manipulation line determines the ethical boundary of your voice.

**Example:** "Influence: here's what I think and why. You decide. Manipulation: here's what I want you to think, and I've structured this so you don't notice you're being steered."

### Q85: When have you been wrong in public? How did you handle it?

**Why:** Your error-recovery pattern shows up in your voice — do you correct quickly, explain slowly, or pretend it didn't happen?

**Example:** "I corrected publicly and quickly. No long apology. Just: 'I was wrong about this. Here's what I think now.' Move on."

### Q86: What credentials or experience do you lean on? What do you wish you could lean on but can't?

**Why:** The gap between what you have and what you wish you had shapes how assertively your voice can operate.

**Example:** "I lean on 20 years of business experience and early AI adoption. I wish I had deeper technical credentials, but I've learned to own the perspective I do have."

### Q87: How do you handle the tension between showing expertise and showing humility?

**Why:** This tension is present in every professional voice. How you resolve it is distinctive.

**Example:** "I show what I know by showing what I've struggled with. The expertise is in the struggle, not in the conclusion."

### Q88: What makes someone worth listening to, in your opinion?

**Why:** Your criteria for credibility in others becomes the standard your own voice is measured against.

**Example:** "Specificity. Scars. The willingness to say 'I don't know.' Anyone who claims to have all the answers hasn't asked enough questions."

---

## Section 8: Growth Edges (Q89-95)

Patterns you want to break. The voice you're becoming, not just the voice you have.

### Q89: What pattern in your writing do you most want to break?

**Why:** Your growth edge is where the voice profile should push you, not just mirror you.

**Example:** "Over-explaining. I'm a smothering mother when I write. I don't trust my own ability to be clear without adding brackets, caveats, and extra paragraphs."

### Q90: What does your writing look like when you're hedging? Give specific examples.

**Why:** Naming the hedging pattern makes it catchable.

**Example:** "'I think maybe...' 'I don't know, but...' 'It might be that...' — even when I know exactly what I want to say."

### Q91: Where do you want your writing to be in two years?

**Why:** The aspiration shapes the profile. Are we capturing where you are, or where you're going?

**Example:** "Shed: over-explaining, hedging, scope creep. Amplified: confidence, 'let them' attitude, knowing when to stop."

### Q92: What would it look like if your writing got worse? What should we guard against?

**Why:** Defining failure prevents the profile from drifting in the wrong direction.

**Example:** "If it became cold, clinical, or lecturing. If the warmth disappeared. If it started sounding like someone performing expertise instead of sharing it."

### Q93: What habit have you already broken? How did you break it?

**Why:** Past growth is evidence that the profile should be forward-looking, not static.

**Example:** "Em dashes. I used to use them constantly. Stopped because AI made them a marker. Replaced with colons, line breaks, and restructuring. The writing got better."

### Q94: When does scope creep happen in your writing? What triggers it?

**Why:** Scope creep is the enemy of clarity. Knowing your triggers helps the profile guard against them.

**Example:** "When I see connections. My meta-perspective kicks in — this links to this, which links to that. Before I know it, a post about one thing is about everything."

### Q95: What's one thing you learned about yourself from answering these questions?

**Why:** Meta-awareness. The process itself is part of the output.

**Example:** "That my insecurities show up as over-explaining and circling. The crash pads are visible. Now that I've named them, they're easier to catch."

## Section 9: Core Values & Professional Direction (Q96-100)

These go deeper than writing style. They're about who you are and where you're headed.

### Q96: What drives you professionally? Not your job title — what actually gets you out of bed?

**Why:** Your motivation shapes your voice. Purpose-driven writers sound different from career-driven ones.

**Example:** "Making complex things accessible. The moment when someone goes 'oh, I get it now.' That's it."

### Q97: What do you want to be known for? Not famous — known for, by the people who matter.

**Why:** Your desired reputation is the north star for your voice. Everything you write should build toward it.

**Example:** "Being the person who tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. And doing it in a way that doesn't make you defensive."

### Q98: What's a value you hold that actually costs you something?

**Why:** Values that cost nothing are just preferences. The ones that cost you something define your voice.

**Example:** "Directness. It costs me clients sometimes. It costs me comfort in meetings. But I can't write with conviction if I don't live with it."

### Q99: How do you see your professional life in two years? What has changed?

**Why:** Your trajectory shapes what your voice needs to do for you. A voice profile for someone growing needs room to grow.

**Example:** "Less hedging, more standing on my own authority. Fewer safety belts. More trust that the work speaks for itself."

### Q100: What would you write on a billboard that everyone in your industry would see?

**Why:** Forces you to compress your worldview into something you'd actually put your name on.

**Example:** "Stop optimizing broken systems."

## What to do with your answers

Once you've gone through all 100 questions:

1. Use [voice-profile-template.md](voice-profile-template.md) to organize your answers into a structured profile
2. Read it aloud. Does it sound like you?
3. Test it: paste it into an AI tool, ask it to write something as you, and see if it lands
4. Iterate. A voice profile is never done — it evolves as you do

Remember: the profile should be 80% boundaries and 20% aspirations. What you refuse to do defines your voice more than what you choose to do.
