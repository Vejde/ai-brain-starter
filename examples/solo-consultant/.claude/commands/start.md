## Session Start

### 1. Context
- What branch is active? Run `git branch --show-current`
- Any uncommitted changes? Run `git status`
- What was the last commit? Run `git log --oneline -3`

### 2. Check Deadlines
- Any client deliverables due this week? Check `projects/` for active engagements
- Any proposals pending? Check `clients/pipeline.md`

### 3. Plan
Ask Maria: "What are we working on today?"

Based on the answer:
- **Client work**: read the relevant project folder, summarize where we left off
- **Business development**: check pipeline, draft outreach or follow-ups
- **Content creation**: check content calendar or draft queue
- **Quick task**: just do it

### 4. Context Budget
Reminder: "Full context window available. I'll run `/compact` at ~50%. Each task should be completable within half the context."

### 5. Commit Discipline
Commit immediately after each completed task. Don't batch.
