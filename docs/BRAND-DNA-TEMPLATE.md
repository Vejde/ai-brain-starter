# Brand DNA Template

A framework for documenting your brand so Claude (and you)
can stay consistent across all communication.

## The Name

What your company name means and why you chose it.

## Mission

One sentence: what you do and for whom.

> "We help [audience] achieve [outcome] through [approach]."

## Vision

Where you're heading:
- **2-year**: ___
- **Long-term**: ___

## Core Positioning

### What We Do
One paragraph.

### What Makes Us Different
Your core differentiator. Not "we care more" -- something concrete.
A metaphor or analogy helps here.

### What We Don't Do
Equally important. Draw the boundary.

## Brand Values (3-5)

For each value:
- **Value name**
- What it means in practice (not platitudes)
- How it shows up in decisions

## Brand Voice

### Characteristics
List 3-5 voice traits. For each:
- Trait name
- What it sounds like
- What it does NOT sound like

### Tone Shifts
How voice adjusts by context:
- Website: ___
- Proposals: ___
- Social media: ___
- Email: ___

## Brand Beliefs

Convictions that drive your work. These are opinionated.
If nobody disagrees, it's not a belief, it's a platitude.

## The Promise

What clients can always expect from working with you.

## Competitive Differentiation

| Factor | Us | Typical Alternative |
|--------|----|--------------------|
| ___ | ___ | ___ |
| ___ | ___ | ___ |

## What Success Looks Like

Concrete outcomes that define success. Not "happy clients" --
measurable, observable results.
